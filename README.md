### App Architecture

1. That's how we see our app:

![app architecture](client/src/assets/readme/App%20architecture.png)

Game is heart of this application, we added beauty using Materializecss, logic by React-Redux and all this inside nodejs-exprees

2. Let's go a little deeper...

![backend-frontend](client/src/assets/readme/Backend-Frontend.png) 

We used one programming language - JavaScript. There is no problem with this on the client. 
On the server side, nodejs and mongodb also use JS. This way the code interacts perfectly.
The main task of the server part is to process server requests - REST API and store data in a database.

3. Registration

![registration](client/src/assets/readme/Registration.png)

Yes, one of the main and obvious server-client relationships is storing and receiving user data. 
And then we did this:
- we use email as login. And validate it. this introduces some limitations but ensures that the user does not create a 
  login like 1234567 or login or something like that.
- it's easier with a password - one requirement! the length limit is 6 characters. any symbols are allowed.
- after checking the data, we send them to the server, where the password is encrypted and saved to the database. Super! 
  Now such a user exists. now you can log in)
  PS: don't worry if you enter something wrong. The hint will not be long in coming. Wrong login, short password, 
  registration of a user under an email that is already registered and much more is already provided. In addition, 
  the whole process of work from entering data to deleting data from the database is covered by tests. See for yourself:
  
`npm run test`

see next:

![tests](client/src/assets/readme/unit-test1.png)

Well, of course, registration is not the most interesting thing in the application (although if you want to get to the interesting, 
then registration will still have to go through) inside - an improved version of the game and the ability to customize the application. 
Initially, you have a good old google dinosaur, a player and a choice of language. After registration, you can go deeper into 
customization and all this will not be lost after restarting the application. And of course our tips will come to help you)

4. MVC

![mvc](client/src/assets/readme/MVC.png)

This is the most interesting. Technical aspects of implementation. Of course, the coolest thing is a game, but it is 
encapsulated and embedded in the general application system and is nothing more than just a block. Smart interesting 
funny block. But how does it work?

<hr/>

If at this stage I start talking about the technologies, libraries and frameworks that we have used, then I am almost 
100% sure that you will start scrolling down the page with the hope that there might be something interesting there. 
I will not load you with boring dry information that you can easily find on Google. But if you're interested, links and 
descriptions of dependencies are in the attached file above.
I'll do it a little differently. I'll tell you how we did what we did.

### Episode 1. Does anyone have any idea how we can do all this?

We are 4 people in development. but we are not completely strangers. two had previously done one COVID19 project and 
two another. but there the level and complexity of the application was completely different. In general, of course, 
we started with an acquaintance. We told about ourselves about the technologies that we can help the project and how we 
generally imagine what should turn out

We started by adding tasks to JIRA and made a small layout:

![layout](client/src/assets/readme/UserFlow.png)

The plan was this:
1. There will be a name for the game (which still does not exist)
2. For some reason there will be registration
3. There will be a game
4. We will win

### Episode 2. Details

Considering all the requirements, we decided to use React. The ideal SPA solution. But we did not start with him. 
We started by creating a structure for the server side of the application. So. We only know JavaScript. It is logical 
to use technologies using this language - NODE.js and Mongodb. Excellent. Here we are developing MERN applications

### Episode 3. Server

Express helped a lot. Express's excellent documentation and uncomplicated organization helped to set up REST. 
mongoose helped make a schema for the database collection and connect it to the server. Once again, Express's excellent 
documentation helped set up the registration system. express-validator, jsonwebtoken and bcryptjs - these libraries we 
used for data validation and encryption. Don't worry, nobody will know your secrets)). As you can see, the encrypted 
password is stored in the database and even we cannot find out

![mongodb account](client/src/assets/readme/mongodbAccount.png)

It remains only to add that with the help of jest and supertest we covered all requests to Mongodb tests.

### Episode 4. Client

Let's go more fun) I wanted to get some kind of UI and see something other than the code. But it's not that simple. 
The server was using localhost: 5000 and the client was localhost: 5000 and needed to somehow get them to work together. 
And of course libraries came to the rescue again. concurrently from the server and setting up the proxy from the 
client and you're done! By this time, the design was ready:

![figma](client/src/assets/readme/figma.png)

[Link to Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/pqHW72fHEJr5O7Q4lG5uQK/Logo?node-id=0%3A1)

Now, of course, a lot is different. But we hope that it only got better)

And the work began to boil. By that time, everyone already knew their roles. The beauty of the application was 
supported by materialize-css. The logic is redux and react-redux. Well, so that it was a full-fledged SPA - react, 
react-dom, react-router-dom.

### Episode 5. Finishing touch

The application received an interesting appearance, musical accompaniment and attracted the user to register. 
By the way, in addition to registration, authentication is available (configured with react-google-login). 
After registration, an updated version of the game and custom settings are available. The MVC pattern helped to implement 
them, where logic is redux and visualization is react.

### Episode 6. The Game

And last but not least - the Game! React has already been. So the engine for the game needed exactly the one that was 
ready to interact with the react - phaser. We chose him and did not regret it! There were some nuances in adapting the 
application. After all, in addition to it, we also worked with materialize-css. We have to look for the optimal solution. 
Our react is on hooks. We chose them instead of class components. And it was hooks that helped us with solving many 
problems associated with integration.

### Episode 7. Thanks

This application is a good experience for us - team development is a completely different level. Here you are not alone)
We hope our application will seem interesting to you and you will not regret the time spent on it, or maybe our experience 
will help you in the future. Good luck and thanks for reading to the end)
